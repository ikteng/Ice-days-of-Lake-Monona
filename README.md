# Ice-days-of-Lake-Monona

The Downloaded Data is from https://climatology.nelson.wisc.edu/first-order-station-climate-data/madison-climate/lake-ice/history-of-ice-freezing-and-thawing-on-lake-monona/

The data.csv is data extracted from the downloaded data and used for the program. It is created by the create_csv() function.

This program will create a plot.jpg by plotting points on a Number of Frozen Days vs Year according to the data.

The program will also make a prediction, model interpretation and model limitation.

Issues:
There seems to be an issue with where the data.csv and the downloaded_data.csv is located at.
It has to be at the most outside of the folder to work.
This needs further improvement.
